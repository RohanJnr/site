This is all of the code that is responsible for maintaining [our website][7] and all of its subdomains.

The website is built on Django and should be simple to set up and get started with.
If you happen to run into issues with setup, please don't hesitate to open an issue!

If you're looking to contribute or play around with the code, take a look at [the wiki][8] or the [`docs` directory](docs). If you're looking for things to do, check out [our issues][9].
